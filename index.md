I’m a customer advocate and occasional front-end developer working and living in Atlanta, Georgia.

Over the past few years, I’ve had the great pleasure of working on projects with a few agencies, nonprofits, and a couple incredible software companies. To learn a bit more [about me](/about) and [what I do](/projects), please feel free to take a look around! Thank you for your time.
