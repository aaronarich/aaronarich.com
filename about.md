I’m originally from South Carolina, but I’ve been working as a front-end developer in Atlanta since 2012. Some of what I enjoy most about my profession is collaborating with others in a team setting, working on projects that are challenging, and constantly learning how to improve my workflow.

My biggest inspirations in life are [my wife](https://www.instagram.com/p/40BVwlid-X/), the open-road, and mountaintops. Counting back to when we first met, my wife and I have driven to 28 states together, with [Montana](https://www.instagram.com/p/4xwu7mCd7t/) and [Maine](https://www.instagram.com/p/BKBU0c0hd_x/) being our favorites so far. I don’t think we’ll ever drive to Hawaii… but Alaska seems doable. When we’re not driving around the country, our long term goal is to settle down and start a family farm and raise honeybees.
